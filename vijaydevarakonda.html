<h2> born on 9th may 1989 </h2>
<p>Deverakonda made his debut with Nuvvila (2011) and received praise for his role in the coming-of-age drama Yevade Subramanyam (2015). He rose to prominence as a leading film actor by starring in the blockbusters Pelli Choopulu (2016) and Arjun Reddy (2017), winning the Filmfare Award for Best Actor â€“ Telugu for his performance as a volatile surgeon in the latter. He further established himself with commercially successful films such as Mahanati (2018), Geetha Govindam (2018), and Taxiwaala (2018).[5][6] This success was followed by a series of poorly received films such as the critically panned big-budget action film Liger (2022).</P>
